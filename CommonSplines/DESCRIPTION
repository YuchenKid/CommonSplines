Description: This is an R package that covers commonly seen nonparametric regression using spline-based methods. For regression spline, commonly seen basis functions are provided such as truncated power basis, natural cubic spline basis, and B-spline basis. For regularization, penalties on squared second-order derivative are provided, i.e., cubic smoothing spline.This package mainly refer to “Friedman, J., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2001).
